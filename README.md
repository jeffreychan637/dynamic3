#Dynamic3
###Dynamic3 is a library built on top of [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) that makes it simple and easy to build powerful, dynamic, animated graphs that features real-time data.

###The library supports 3 types of graphs.

####The Circle Graph
The circle graph is a graph that displays a single value in the form of a circle whose size is determined by the value. As the value grows, the displayed circle grows bigger and vice versa. It's useful where the size of single value is the sole focus such as the amount of people tweeting about a certain topic or the amount of people in the world currently sick with an infectious disease.

####The Ever-Changing Bar Graph
The ever-changing bar graph is a bar graph where the values of categories change over time reflected in the ever-changing lengths of the bars in the graphs. It's useful for data where values change but the categories of those values always stay the same such as real-time basketball stats for different players in a specific game.

####The Expanding Bar Graph
The expanding bar graph is a bar graph where the categories of the graph change over time, while the values do not. It's useful for data that's logged based on time such as the amount of steps taken every day by a user or the amount of requests a server receives every 20 seconds.
